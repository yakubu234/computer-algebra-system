                    We believe that in order to have a successful website, you need to constantly adjust and adapt to
                    the data provided by your website visitors. Here at Pierre Web Development, we have narrowed down
                    the specific key performance indicators that will dramatically boost your success with connecting to
                    target markets. We will provide a basic metric dashboard based on how much traffic your site gets,
                    detailed analytical reports that show which parts of your website is the most popular among visitors
                    as well as access to tools you can use to make meaningful decisions based on this data.
